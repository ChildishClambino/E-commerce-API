Welcome to My Ultimate E-Commerce API!
--------------------------------------
This is an application made with python, flask, Mysql, and Postman!

The first thing you should know about this app is that it was run on a virtual enviornment! If you do not have the necessary packages u may have to intall them using the pip install command in the terminal!

You also may want to set up a virtual enviornment in case some of the installs conflict with other projects or packages in the future!

=======================================
In order to run this program you need to run 

set FLASK_APP=e-commerce_api
flask run

in the command prompt/terminal

Option 2 open up vscode and use the run button
=======================================

While running the application you can access the requests in postman.

Making sure that every request is being connected with the proper endpoint.

 Also, there should be tables as shown with the "db_models" portion of the e-commerce_api.py
 ======================================

  For example, when using the delete customer request you can delete a customer based on their id.
